Description: Heimdall - Interactive curses-based port and process viewer
 Heimdall monitors listening ports, processes, connections, resource usage,
 and warnings using the witr tool.

 It provides a curses interface for sysadmins to inspect why processes exist,
 their origins, file descriptors, runtime types, and potential security risks.
 .
 Requires the 'witr' binary to be installed separately.
