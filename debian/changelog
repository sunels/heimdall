heimdall (0.9.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * SECURITY FIX: Tree Kill (Force Kill Tree) completely rewritten for safety:
    - Previous implementation used Process Group (PGRP) kill which could
      terminate unrelated processes including gnome-shell and the desktop session.
    - New implementation uses strict ancestor scan (upward) + child sweep
      (downward) approach — never kills the user's login shell or display server.
    - Added HARD_PROTECT set: gnome-shell, Xorg, systemd, terminator, konsole,
      sshd, tmux, pulseaudio, NetworkManager and more are now fully protected.
  * NEW: Port Orphan Sweep (Phase 3.5):
    - After tree imha, performs an additional ss-based scan to kill orphan
      processes (e.g. nc instances reparented to systemd from dead scripts)
      that are still holding the target port.
  * NEW: Script Loop Detection:
    - Processes managed by a script (.sh/.py/.js etc.) are now marked with
      a 🌲 icon in the main table.
    - When stopping or force-killing such a process, Heimdall prompts:
      "Kill Entire Tree" vs "Only This Process" to prevent immediate respawning.
  * IMPROVED: kill_process_group now auto-detects port if not supplied.
